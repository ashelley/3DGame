# Magic Editor

This program is used to edit various abilities usable in the game. 

Current progress - Abilities fully editable, load and save from disk complete (any forgotten attributes like Range like I now realised and any special skill requisites can be added into the custom dictionary used by each skill).

Next TODO - saving/loading of class templates with skilltrees.

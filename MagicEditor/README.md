This program is used to edit various abilities usable in the game. 

Current progress - needs to load/save from disk (to be implemented in GameObjects instead so that the game itself can reuse code), needs to have user interface to switch between editing different abilities ( a list pane) as well as add/remove to said list.

Below screenshot of the editing process:

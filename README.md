# 3DGame
3D game in ``MonoGame``

Doing this mostly from scratch, for my own entertainment, to better understand all the different processes that go on in complex games.

To be completed when I'm 70 and have a beard.

Outdated even before I started (yes, it used XNA when first created, a few years after XNA was declared dead).

Also, a lot of game-related stuff seems to be bits of arcane knowledge that nobody's willing to share. Well, guess what, I am willing. 

If you use any code from here, I pity you. Please do not try to locate my whereabouts for the purpose of prolonged torture followed by murder.

... hope it helps, though.
